# GARAGE 
Hi all developers, this is my first project. I'm learning with goal to enter in this world.

This is my first "project", where i manage the entry and exit of cars from a garage.
The cars can be of 3 types,
- normal car
- luxury car
- van car

When each car arrives, it will be assigned a car place, removing it from the parking list for future entries, while when the car leaves, the parking will be freed up for the future arrival of other cars and payment will be managed based on to the number of hours.
